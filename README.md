#  PodBot - Hack the North 2020

## Overview



## Installation



## Model

To create our bot, we used transfer learning on the pre-trained Blenderbot 90M model. The Blender chatbot was created by Facebook and was created to replicate realistic conversation. There are 3 different variants of Blenderbots: 90M, 2.7B, and 9.4B. We chose the smallest variant due to our resource and time limitations. The Blender chatbots are pre-trained on the pushshift.io Reddit dataset.

## Transfer Learning Data

We scraped 150 transcripts from the Tim Ferriss Show which we used to custom train our model.
